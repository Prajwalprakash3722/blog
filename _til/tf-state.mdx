> sudo reflector --verbose -l 200 -n 20 -p https --sort rate --country IN --save
/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist <br />

--verbose: tells the reflector to output the process logs <br/>
-l 200: Limits the number of mirrors to include in the list to 200.<br/>
-n 20: Specifies that it should fetch the 20 most recently updated mirrors.<br/>
-p https: Filters mirrors that support the HTTPS protocol.<br/>
--sort rate: Sorts the mirrors based on download rate.<br/>
--country IN: Filters mirrors by country, in this case, India.<br/>
--save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist: Saves the updated mirror list to the specified file.<br/>

<br />
Then just the below command to update your system
<br />
> sudo pacman -Syyu
<br />
<br />
tada :)
