I wanted to recently upgrade the arch linux, (I know I have broken it so many times just by updating it, this time I wanted to do it clearly), Before updating it is a good pratice to update the mirrors so that your packages will be latest and downladed faster,
As I shifted from Ubuntu I was manually loking for fastest mirrors and trying to manually update the mirrorlist, that's when I came across `Reflector` a tool which automatically scans for the mirror lists based on the parameters you supply and sorts them in fastest to slow order and also updates the mirror list with just one command
<br/><br/>
> sudo reflector --verbose -l 200 -n 20 -p https --sort rate --country IN --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist <br/><br/>

--verbose: tells the reflector to output the process logs <br/>
-l 200: Limits the number of mirrors to include in the list to 200.<br/>
-n 20: Specifies that it should fetch the 20 most recently updated mirrors.<br/>
-p https: Filters mirrors that support the HTTPS protocol.<br/>
--sort rate: Sorts the mirrors based on download rate.<br/>
--country IN: Filters mirrors by country, in this case, India.<br/>
--save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist: Saves the updated mirror list to the specified file.<br/>
<br/>
Then just the below command to update your system
<br/>
> sudo pacman -Syyu
<br/><br/>
tada :)
