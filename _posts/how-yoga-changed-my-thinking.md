# How Yoga Changed My Thinking

I found my way back to yoga this year. As a kid, I was an ardent lover of it but somehow drifted away. Now I'm back, stronger than ever, with 210+ hours on my mat.

Every morning at 5:50 AM (or sometimes 7 PM), I show up. Each time I roll out my mat, I question myself, but 20-30 minutes in, I feel rejuvenated and proud for showing up.

Yoga has taught me that real change happens slowly. It's in the little things â€“ how I face mornings, handle tough stuff, or just breathe when things get hard.

These days, I meditate too. Five quiet minutes can change my whole day. It's wild how something so simple can do so much. I used to skeptically view meditation, but now I embrace it fully.

I'm stronger now, sure. But the real gift? The peace in my head. Yoga isn't just exercise anymore â€“ it's part of me.

If you're thinking about trying: just start. Do it your way. The magic isn't in perfect poses â€“ it's in showing up for yourself, one breath at a time.

Some Improvements I've Noticed:

- My Heart Rate is Lower while sleeping (avg 55-65 BPM) (measured using Apple Watch, It's pretty accurate)
- I don't care about little things anymore, I've learned to let go
- I'm crazy flexible now, I can touch my toes without bending my knees, lol
- Have a better posture now, I don't slouch anymore :)
