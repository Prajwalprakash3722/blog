Hi Everyone,

Today is a special day for me as I turn 21. I wanted to take a moment to share some of the thoughts that have been running through my mind. It's a strange feelingâ€”I'm not quite sure if I'm happy or sad. When I was younger, I often daydreamed about what I would be like when I grew up.

As a child, I always yearned for the biggest birthday bash. Looking back now, I'm grateful that I didn't have one. I don't think I would have truly enjoyed it. My life has taken a different path than what I had imagined, and while I am genuinely happy with where I am, I can't help but wonder what my 6-year-old self would have done differently if he could see who I am today. What would he think?

Over the past 20 years, I have learned so much about life. It's amazing to look back and realize the blessings I've had and truly blessed to have out standing amazing parents like I do, to be lucky to have the friends I have and to be able to do the things I have done.

TBH turning 21 isn't bad overall you get to do a lot more things, but I guess it's just a reminder that I'm getting older and I'm not a kid anymore, I'm an adult and I have to start acting like one.

> never let the kid inside you die

But above quote always hits me and I go back to acting like a child again trying to enjoy life's simple pleasures.

I do of course realise that 21 is very young but I can't help think of that little boy who used to who used to sit and eat chips with curd (I Know it's a weird combination and I still like it to this day lol) and read big books and wonder what he would think of who I have become?

I hope he'd proud :) cheers, happy birthday to me.

Thank you for taking the time to read my late-night musings. :)
