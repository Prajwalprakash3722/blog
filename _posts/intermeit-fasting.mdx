# Intermittent Fasting for 2 Months: My Journey (and Struggles!)

Two months down, and feeling energized!   I'm not the fittest, but I wanted to make some healthy changes.  Those love handles?   Yeah, they were definitely a target, but weight loss wasn't my only motivator.  Honestly, I just wanted to see if I could stick with something new and create a healthier lifestyle.

Let me tell you honestly, starting intermittent fasting (IF) was a leap of faith.  Would I be able to keep it up?   Looking back, I'm proud to say I did it, and it feels like something I can actually maintain for the long haul.

## My Simple IF Rules:
<b>
  1. Lights out for food by 9:30 PM. 
  2. Breakfast became a 1:30 PM party. Yep, a slightly delayed start to the eating window.
</b>

I upped my protein intake to 70-90 grams a day and went a little easier on the carbs.

Workout Woes :)

Working out has been a part of my routine for a year now, but timing became the new challenge.  Evening gym sessions were regular for me, I made a switch to mornings (6-7:30 AM to be exact).

The first few weeks were brutal.  Surrounded by tempting snacks at home?  Major test of willpower.  But my folks actually helped me stay on track.  Guess a change of scenery does the body (and the mind) good!

## The Unexpected Payoff

The scale might not have screamed "amazing results," but my body definitely noticed a difference.  My energy levels soared, and I felt more active throughout the day.  Focus?  It became my new superpower, crushing work and studies with laser focus.

## What's Next?

The future of IF is looking bright!  I'm ready to take things to the next level.  16/8 feels easy peasy now, so why not try some 24-hour fasts?  Once a week to start, with room to grow from there.

This journey has just begun, and I'll be back in another 2-3 months to share more insights. Until then, Ciao! ðŸŒŸðŸ¥‚

[Note: Consistency means taking some well-deserved days off. It's about finding the balance!]
