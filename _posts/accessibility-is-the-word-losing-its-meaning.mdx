## What is Accessibility?

People often get confused about accessibility. Is it just about being able to reach something? Or is it about actually being able to use it? Let's break it down in simple terms.

The real question is, what is the meaning of the word '**accessibility**'?

Let's take a look at the definition of the word 'accessibility' in Wikipedia:

> Accessibility is the design of products, devices, services, vehicles, or environments so as to be usable by people with disabilities.

From my perspective as someone who is deaf, accessibility goes far beyond mere access – it's about enabling everyone to participate fully and independently in daily life. It's about creating an inclusive world where disability doesn't mean dependency.

## Real-World Examples

Let me share a common scenario. In banking software, when you log into your account, you often have to enter a CAPTCHA code to verify you're human. If you're visually impaired, you might need to use the audio CAPTCHA option. This works for many people, but what about someone who is both visually impaired and hard of hearing? They can't see the visual CAPTCHA or hear the audio version. In this case, the software isn't truly accessible because they can't use it independently.

As someone who is deaf, I've faced numerous accessibility challenges in my daily life. Here are some real experiences: (these barely scratch the surface)

### 1. Getting Food Delivered
- When I'm hungry late at night, I order food online
- Delivery people try to call me for directions
- They can't reach me by phone
- Sometimes they just cancel my order because we can't communicate

### 2. Getting a Ride
- Booking a cab or auto becomes unnecessarily complicated
- Drivers usually call to confirm my location
- Most don't text back when I request them to
- Rides often get canceled due to communication barriers

### 3. Work Communication
Think about those work calls. Everyone's having this flowing conversation, but for those of us relying on captions, we're always a few seconds behind. This can't be solved easily; it needs significant effort and time from major corporations to make it happen.


You know what's really frustrating? When simple everyday moments become awkward just because we haven't thought about different ways people might need to communicate. It's not that the delivery person or driver doesn't want to help - they absolutely do! But when systems are built with just one type of person in mind, they unintentionally shut others out. It's not just inconvenient - it's isolating.

These aren't huge, unsolvable problems. They're small gaps that, when bridged, could make life smoother for everyone. Because here's the truth: none of us know when we might need a different way to do things. Making services accessible isn't just about helping some of us - it's about making things better for all of us.

## What Can Be Done?

### Use Better Technology
- Create apps that are inclusive by design, considering various user needs, be open to take feedbacks and improve
- Let people choose how they want to communicate
- Use new technology to help people understand each other

### Improve Staff Training
- Teach workers about different needs
- Establish clear SOP's to help everyone
- Make sure everyone knows what to do, even if they don't, making it not awkward for anyone must be the goal

### Expand Communication Options
- Let people choose between calling, texting, or email
- What works for someone might not work for others
- When things work for everyone, they work better for all of us

## Creating Inclusive Spaces

### Understanding Each Other
- Recognize that accessibility needs vary among individuals
- Acknowledge that standard solutions don't work for everyone
- Remember that inclusive design benefits the entire community

### Taking Action
- Advocate for better accessibility features
- Share positive experiences with accessible services
- Provide constructive feedback to improve existing systems

## Looking Forward

Accessibility isn't losing its meaning – it's evolving. As our world becomes increasingly connected, the importance of true accessibility grows. It's not just about making things available; it's about ensuring everyone can participate fully in society, regardless of their abilities.

The goal of this post isn't to highlight problems but to inspire solutions. Every accessibility challenge presents a unique opportunity to innovate and create better experiences for everyone. When we design with accessibility in mind, we create a better world that includes everyone.

Remember: Accessibility isn't a feature – it's a fundamental right. By working together, we can create a more inclusive and accessible world for everyone.
