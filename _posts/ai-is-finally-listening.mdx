Remember when I wrote about accessibility losing its meaning? [Read here](https://blog.devcoffee.me/posts/accessibility-is-the-word-losing-its-meaning).

About those cancelled food orders and ride-hails because drivers couldn't reach me by phone? Well, here's the thing – the tech world is finally waking up. And honestly? It's about time.

## Apple's Live Captions – A Game Changer (Mostly)

Apple introduced Live Captions a while back, and with recent iOS updates, it's gotten even better. The feature transcribes phone calls in real-time, right there on your screen. Think about what that means for a moment. For years, I avoided phone calls like the plague. Text me, email me, anything but call me. Now? I can actually pick up the phone and follow along.

It's not perfect – there are quirks, sometimes it lags, and the accuracy depends heavily on how clearly the other person speaks. But here's the beautiful part: it works across FaceTime, regular calls, podcasts, videos – basically anything with audio on your device. No special setup. No third-party apps. Just toggle it on in `Settings > Accessibility > Live Captions`.

The announcement about calls being transcribed might make some people uncomfortable, but honestly? It's a small price for inclusion.

## But Here's What Frustrates Me

Apple restricts Live Captions to US and English. That's it.

Let that sink in. A company worth trillions of dollars, building features that could genuinely change lives, and they gatekeep it based on geography and language. If you're sitting in Bengaluru or Mumbai or anywhere outside their blessed English-speaking bubble? Sorry, you don't matter enough.

This isn't a technical limitation. This is a choice. And it's the kind of choice that tells you exactly where accessibility sits on their priority list – somewhere below "nice to have" and above "we'll get to it eventually."

Imagine being deaf in India. You finally hear about this life-changing feature. You get excited. You update your phone. And then you discover – it's not for you. Your language, your accent, your existence wasn't considered worth the investment.

That's not accessibility. That's selective inclusion. And selective inclusion is just exclusion with better marketing.

## And Then There Are LLMs – The Real Game Changer

Here's where it gets interesting. Large Language Models aren't just chatbots you use to write emails or debug code. They're quietly becoming something far more powerful for accessibility.

Think about what an LLM actually does – it processes language, understands context, and generates meaningful responses. Now imagine that applied to the daily struggles of someone who's deaf:

**Real-time context, not just captions**: Current captions give you words. But conversations aren't just words – they're tone, they're subtext, they're the thing someone didn't say but everyone understood. An LLM watching a transcript could tell you "this person seems upset" or "they're being sarcastic" or "the meeting just shifted from casual to serious." That's not transcription. That's understanding.

**Summarization that actually helps**: You know those work calls where you're three seconds behind on captions, and by the time you've processed what was said, the conversation has moved on? Now imagine an LLM that catches you up in real-time. "Quick summary: They decided to postpone the launch. John disagreed but was overruled. Action item for you: update the timeline by Friday." That's not a feature. That's finally being included in the conversation.

**Language flexibility**: For many deaf individuals, written English works differently. Grammar rules that hearing people take for granted can be genuinely confusing. LLMs can rephrase, simplify, and adjust – not dumbing things down, but making them accessible. Meeting someone where they are instead of demanding they come to you.

**The bigger vision**: What if every video call had an AI that could detect when someone's trying to interrupt, and visually flagged it for you? What if presentations automatically generated visual summaries alongside audio? What if your phone could tell you "the barista is asking if you want sugar" without you having to explain, again, that you can't hear them?

We're not there yet. But for the first time, the technology to get there actually exists.

## What Still Needs Work

Let's be real – we're far from done.

- Captions still lag in fast-paced conversations, and that delay isn't just annoying – it's isolating
- Accuracy takes a hit in noisy environments or with accents that don't sound like American
- Regional languages? Kannada? Hindi? Tamil? Still waiting. Still invisible.
- The technology exists in silos – Apple's thing doesn't talk to Google's thing doesn't integrate with Microsoft's thing

And here's the uncomfortable truth: most of this tech is built by hearing people, for hearing people, with deaf accessibility as an afterthought. The features exist because they're marketable, not because the companies genuinely understand what it's like to miss half a conversation and smile anyway because you're tired of asking people to repeat themselves.

## The Bigger Picture

You know what gets me about all this?

It's not the technology. Technology is just a tool. What matters is what it represents – a world slowly, grudgingly, starting to acknowledge that communication is a right, not a privilege.

Every time someone says "just call me," they're assuming everyone can hear. Every time a company releases a feature only in English, they're deciding whose struggles matter. Every time accessibility is treated as a "nice to have," someone gets left behind.

But here's the thing – none of us know when we might need a different way to do things. The parent who loses their hearing at 50. The kid born deaf in a small town with no resources. The accident that changes everything overnight.

Accessibility isn't charity. It's not a favour companies do for "those people." It's building a world that works for humans – all of us messy, different, unpredictable humans.

## What You Can Do

- **Use these features, even if you don't need them.** Live Captions in a noisy coffee shop? Game changer for everyone.
- **Give feedback.** Companies respond to volume. Make noise.
- **Advocate for multilingual support.** English-first accessibility isn't good enough for a global world.
- **If you're building something – anything – think about accessibility from day one.** Not as a feature. As a foundation.

Remember what I said before – accessibility isn't a feature, it's a fundamental right.

And maybe, just maybe, the tech world is starting to understand that.

Let's keep pushing them to do better. ❤️
