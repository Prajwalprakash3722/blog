In this article, we will look at some of the best Heroku alternatives as it has announced to stop supporting the free tier (hobby) plan from November 28th 2022.You can read more about this [here](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter/).
I still remember the first time I deployed an application on Heroku, It was so easy to deploy.
It was a simple Flask application that I had cloned from [hastebin](https://hastebin.com/), I still think its deployed somewhere on Heroku. [hastebin-clone](https://haste-bin-clone.herokuapp.com/)
It literally deployed any code I threw at it that too for free. I was amazed at how easy it was to deploy an application on Heroku.It was essiential to any developer starting out.
Earlier in the days it was not easy to run code on server, it required a special set of knowledge and skills to run code on a server.]]></description>
